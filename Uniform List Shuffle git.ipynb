    "This function `random_shuffle(x)` will shuffle a list uniformly, i.e. reorder it by a uniformly random permutation.  E.g. `random_shuffle([3,4,5])` should return one of the $3!=6$ possible lists `[3,4,5],[3,5,4],[4,3,5],[4,5,3],[5,3,4],[5,4,3]` each time it is called, with each possibility appearing with probability $1/3!=1/6$.  There are library functions that do this, but here we want to do it from first principles, using only `random()` and/or `randrange()`. The function will work even for a list of length 0 or 1."
